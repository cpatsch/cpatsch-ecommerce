# cpatsch-ecommerce application
>[!NOTE]
> This is a comprehensive repository for a ecommerce application. It is divided into individual parts, where each branch highlights a new feature. For example, the login feature is located in the "dev-login" branch. At the end, each feature will be merged into one branch to create an entire program. This is being done to set up to specify goals and to prevent burnout.

#### Project Details:
This project is written with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, using React. The goal with this project is to learn Javascript, and React, while practicing HTML and CSS by creating a full-stack e-commerce application. The backend will be written with .NET in C# but that will be added later.

The database that this application is using will be a SQL database hosted locally.

The end goal of this project is to host it on a server, either Azure or AWS. However, this will be a decision for a later time.
